**Projects**
Here is a short summory of a couple of the different projects you will find in this portfolio

*Pacman-Game*
An interpretation of the classic Pacman game, built using C#. The game implements advanced object oriented concepts such as bridge-and strategy patterns, factory method patterns, iterators and parametric polymorphism. Ghost behavior is controlled using multiple algorithms, while interactions between game entities are managed through subtype polymorphism.

*Password-Manager*
The program stores, retrieves, and manages passwords with AES encryption and SHA-256 hashing. It supports master passwords, automatic password generation, and JSON-based storage, showcasing secure programming. 

*Website*
A dynamic website built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It features user registration, login/logout, commenting, client- and server-side validation, secure password hashing and salting, protection against SQL injection, and asynchronous interactions using AJAX.

*Booking-System-Database*
A hotel management database built with SQLite, designed to handle hotels, rooms, employees, guests, bookings, and services. It tracks room availability, booking details, and invoices, providing a complete structure for hotel operations.
